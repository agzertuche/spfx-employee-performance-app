## Summary

Sample SPFx webpart built using React, also illustrating different scenarios to fetch data from SP REST, PnP, MS Graph and Mockup data.

![Alt Text](./EmployeePerformanceApp_Demo.gif)

## Features

This webpart illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

- Using React for building SharePoint Framework client-side webparts
- Using Office UI Fabric React styles for building user experience consistent with SharePoint and Office
- Communicating with the Microsoft Graph, SharePoint REST API and PnP API
- Passing webpart properties to React components

### Solution configuration

- [Integrate TSLint with VSCode](https://joelfmrodrigues.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/tslint-spfx/)

  1. Install TSLint extension on VSCode
  2. Add a `tslint.json` file on the root of the project to tell the extension to get its rules from the `config` folder:
     ```
     {
       "rulesDirectory": "./config"
     }
     ```

- [Integrate Prettier with VSCode](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html#visual-studio-code)

  1. Install Prettier extension: `ext install prettier-vscode`
  2. Add a `.prettierrc` file to the root of the project to tell the extension to use the following prettier rules:
     ```
     {
       "singleQuote": true
     }
     ```
  3. **IMPORTANT:** To avoid rule conflicts between TSLint and Prettier we need to install some packages and update TSLint rules:

     - `npm install --save-dev tslint tslint-config-prettier tslint-eslint-rules tslint-react`
     - Update `./config/tslint.json` file to extend the default linting functionality:

     ```
     "lintConfig": {
       "extends": [
         "tslint:latest",
         "tslint-react",
         "tslint-eslint-rules",
         "tslint-config-prettier"
       ],
       "rules": {
         ... // other rules omitted for brevity
         "quotemark": [true, "single", "jsx-double"]
       }
     }
     ```

* [Configure precommit hook with Husky, Lint-staged and Prettier](https://github.com/typicode/husky)

  1. Install packages: `npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged prettier`
  2. Edit the `package.json` file to configure the git hooks as following:

  ```
    "scripts": {
      ... // other scripts omitted for brevity
      "precommit": "lint-staged",
    },
    "lint-staged": {
      "*.{json,css,scss,md}": [
        "prettier --write",
        "git add"
      ],
      "*.{js,ts,tsx}": [
        "tslint --fix",
        "prettier --single-quote --parser typescript --write",
        "git add"
      ]
    },
  ```

3. Now, everytime `git commit` command is executed, the staged files will be formatted according to tslint and prettier rules configured.

### Configure Webpart

- [Configure webpart group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/simplify-adding-web-parts-with-preconfigured-entries)

  On `src/EmployeePerformanceAppWebPart.manifest.json` file, update following properties:

  - Group GUID for modern experience:

  ```
    "groupId": "1bc7927e-4a5e-4520-b540-71305c79c20a", // GUID for Planning and process
  ```

  - Group name for classic experience:

  ```
    "group": {
        "default": "[Group-name]",
      },
  ```

* [Configure webpart icon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/basics/configure-web-part-icon)

  **NOTE**: This icon only apply for modern sites.

  1. The easiest way to configure a webpart icon is to use an icon name from [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/styles/icons)
  2. On `src/EmployeePerformanceAppWebPart.manifest.json` file, update following property:

  ```
    "officeFabricIconFontName": "[icon-name]",
  ```

- [Configure custom App icon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/basics/notes-on-solution-packaging)

  **NOTE**: This icon only apply for classic sites.

  1. Get an image icon with 96px to 96px dimension.
  2. Upload the icon to the `sharepoint/images` folder
  3. On `config/package-solution.json` file, update following property to reference the new icon:

  ```
    "iconPath": "images/[icon-name].png",
  ```

- [Provisioning SharePoint assets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/provision-sp-assets-from-package)

  This sample webpart provide four different list to a SharePoint site

  1. Add SP List schemas inside the `sharepoint/assets` folder
  2. Add a "features" option on `config/package-solution.json` file to reference the lists schemas as following:

  ```
  "solution": {
      ... // other scripts omitted for brevity
      "features": [
        {
          "title": "employee-performance-app-assets",
          "description": "List assets for employee performance app",
          "id": "368d2b60-be42-4505-986a-5f775c922780",
          "version": "1.0.0.0",
          "assets": {
            "elementManifests": ["elements.xml"],
            "elementFiles": [
              "employeesListSchema.xml",
              "achievementsListSchema.xml",
              "earnedAchievementsListSchema.xml",
              "performanceSkillsListSchema.xml"
            ]
          }
        }
      ],
    }
  ```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Set up development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment?view=sp-typescript-latest)

### Adding the WebPart to your page

To add this webpart to your site page you have two options :

- Either clone this repository, build the project yourself and connect it to SharePoint (see [officedev documentation](https://dev.office.com/sharepoint/docs/spfx/web-parts/get-started/connect-to-sharepoint))

### Configuring the WebPart

Open the property pane to select one data provider to fetch the information, then click on "Apply" button.

### Building the code

```bash
git clone the repo
npm i
npm i -g gulp
gulp
```

This package produces the following:

- lib/\* - intermediate-stage commonjs build artifacts
- dist/\* - the bundled script, along with other resources
- deploy/\* - all resources which should be uploaded to a CDN.

#### Useful Gulp tasks

- `gulp trust-dev-cert`

  Command to install the developer certificate for building your custom solutions easily with HTTPS endpoint.

- `gulp clean` :

  Command to clear the temporary build folders and files created in the solution. Some of the folders cleaned up during the process are `temp/` and `dist/`.

- `gulp serve` : This command executes a series of gulp tasks to create a local, node-based HTTPS server on `localhost:4321` and launches your default browser to preview webparts from your local dev environment. Note: if you see issues with the certificate in the browser, please run `gulp trust-dev-cert` command. The minified assets can be found under the `temp\deploy` directory.
- `gulp bundle` : Command to build a bundle of your solution.
- `gulp bundle --ship` : This builds the minified assets required to upload to the CDN provider. The `--ship` indicates the build tool to build for distribution.
- `gulp package-solution` : This command packages one or more client-side component manifests, such as webparts, along with the feature XML files referenced in the `package-solution.json` configuration file.
- `gulp package-solution --ship` : Same as the previous command but with `--ship` flag to package minified versions of your components.
- `gulp serve --locale=es-es` : To specify the locale to be used by the local SharePoint workbench. [More info](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/localize-web-parts)
